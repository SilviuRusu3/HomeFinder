# HomeFinder
Helps you find a proper home
The app will help you find the best house or apartment according to your needs and possibilities. (I will use home to describe a house or an apartment)
	LOG-IN
	The log -in will be done using regular email, Facebook or Gmail account.
	First screen for a new user
	In the first screen the user will be asked for a name and to rank order what he likes more about a house location: schools nearby, parking space, distance from work, pubs nearby etc So he will put at rank 1 for example the good access by car (ex: good roads),  2 park nearby, 3 schools nearby etc. He will do the ranking by pulling the corresponding item from its position to the position he wants. If he doesn’t want to rank anything he can skip this screen and the ranking will be set to default.
	Second screen for a new user or first screen for an old user
	In the next screen he will be presented in the upper part with a map showing his location. If he has visited and review any homes their location will be on that map. Clicking on one location on the map will bring the review for that house.
	Above this map he will have an icon for preferences.
	In the middle part he will have the 3 homes with the highest mark calculated from the preferences from the first part and the review the user gives to that specific home.

	Here the user will write the address of the home or get coordinates from GPS(or both). After that a form with the preferences from the first screen will pop up and allow the user to give a grade for every aspect of the location. After that a form with what to check will pop up and the user will be able to grade many aspects of the home. Every aspect will have a small “?” that will explain why this is important when pressed.
